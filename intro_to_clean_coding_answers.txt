1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important?
Clean code is code that is readable and maintainable. It's important because it
lets yourself and others understand your code more easily. It also makes
debugging and changes easier because it should be clear what parts of the code
need to be changed.

2. Another common object that relies on computers is a cellphone. If the code was
not created to an acceptable standard the phone would likely have issues implementing
the basic functioning a phone is expected to be able to do. This could include
issues with the home button, issues charging, and other issues with the UI not
reacting properly.

3. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If
not, refactor the code.

Original:
FUNCTION do(x, y)               // Creating a new function
 IF y = "F" THEN               // Check if y is equal "F"
 SET z to (x−32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 ELSE IF y = "C" THEN          // If y not equal to "F", check if equal to "C"
 SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00   // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 END IF
END FUNCTION

I would not consider this to be clean code. There are many unnecessary comments;
each line has a comment. The function name and variables don't have meaningful
names. At first glance it is hard to tell what this function would do, the comments
are actually what show what the function does, but the purpose of the function
can be made clear within the code. There are also unnecessary 0's in the numbers
and correct indentation is not used throughout.

Refactored:
FUNCTION convertTemperature(temp, scale)
  IF scale is F THEN
    PRINT (temp - 32) * (5/9) "celsius"
  ELSE IF scale is C THEN
    PRINT x * 1.8 + 32 "fahrenheit"
  END IF
END FUNCTION

4. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If
not, refactor the code.

Original:
FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF NOT(total = 0) THEN
     SET percentage to sum / total * 100
 ELSE
   PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 END IF

 PRINT percentage
END FUNCTION

I would consider this to be clean code because it is easily readable and
unnecessary comments/code is not included. It is easy to see what the function
does right away, it calculates percentage. Indentation is used to make the code
easy to read and there are no obscure variable names used.

5. Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples using the
principles you have learned in this checkpoint.
  a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer's transaction and
  receives payment accordingly.

Original:
  FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   END IF
  END FUNCTION

Refactored:
  FUNCTION calculateTotal(subTotal, discountRate)
    PRINT "Your total due is: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION receivePayment(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
    SET total to subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
    IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
      CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
      PRINT "Change due: " + amount - subTotal
    ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
      CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
      PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + total
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

  b. The following function checks out a book if there are no issues with the
  guest's account.

Original:
  FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
    IF guest.accountActive THEN
      IF NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) THEN
        IF guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
          APPEND book to guest.books
          SET book.status to "Checked Out"
          PRINT "Your books have been issued."
        END IF
      END IF
    ELSE
      PRINT "Unable to check out book."
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

Refactored:
  FUNCTION checkout(book, guest)
    IF guest.accountActive AND NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) AND
    guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
      APPEND book to guest.books
      SET book.status to "Checked Out"
      PRINT "Your books have been issued."
    ELSE
      PRINT "Unable to check out book"
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

  c. The following class is a code snippet that should support the transactions
  a customer can perform at an ATM.

Original:
  CLASS BankAccount

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 ....
 ....
 ....

END

Refactored:
CLASS transaction
  FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION withdrawal(amount)
    IF balance > amount THEN
      SET balance to balance - amount
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

CLASS Sales
  FUNCTION creditCardOffer
    IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
      CALL offerCreditCard
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION checkStatus
    IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
      CALL offerCheckingAccount
    END IF
  END FUNCTION
