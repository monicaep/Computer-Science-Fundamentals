Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
It allows programmers to think just about the logic of a program without having
to worry about the syntax of a language. Programmers can easily walk through
step by step of what needs to happen and what needs to be executed.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Pseudocode cannot be read by a computer because it is not a real programming
language. Pseudocode is meant for humans to read, not computers.

Programming Assignment
1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
	PRINT first number
ELSE IF second number is greater than first number THEN
	PRINT second number
ELSE
	PRINT "The numbers are equal"
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR number = 1 to 100
	PRINT number
END FOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT phonebook
INPUT a phone number
FOR phone book number = 1 to phonebook size
	IF phone number is equal to phone book number
		RETURN phonebook name
	ELSE
		RETURN "unknown"
	END IF
END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous questions, implement it in
any computer language of your choice.

```JavaScript
let phonebook = [
	{name: 'Bob', phonenumber: 1234567890},
	{name: 'Sue', phonenumber: 5555555555},
	{name: 'Joe', phonenumber: 2067894567}
];
let phonenumber = 5555555555;
function nameFinder(phonebook, phonenumber) {
	for (let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
		if (phonenumber == phonebook[i].phonenumber) {
			return phonebook[i].name;
		} else {
			return "unknown"
		}
	}
}
```
