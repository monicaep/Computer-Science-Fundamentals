1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

	Making coffee:
	FUNCTION makeCoffee(cups)
	   POUR water into the coffee maker reservoir up the the line that is EQUAL TO the 	   the number of cups of coffee
	   INSERT paper filter into compartment 
	   SCOOP an equal amount of scoops as desired cups of coffee
	   PRESS the on button
	END FUNCTION
	
	Washing dishes:
	FUNCTION wash dishes
	   
	END FUNCTION
	
	A choice of your own:
	FUNCTION petCat()
	   WHILE cat looks happy
	      Pet cat
	   END WHILE
	END FUNCTION

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
I think an efficient algorithm involves using steps that are not overly complicated/costly/complex. The steps of an efficient algorithm should be fairly simple to follow. Also, it should not include unnecessary steps. I think an efficient algorithm also means that the algorithm can be easily applied as a solution to different problems. If an algorithm can only solve one problem, it is not very efficient.
