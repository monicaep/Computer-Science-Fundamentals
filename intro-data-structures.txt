1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

- The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
- There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
- When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
- People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their
place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the
following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should
insert Mary after Mike.
c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position
of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it 
does not find the item in the array?
e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of
her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
  ```
  let people = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
  ```

b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should
insert Mary after Mike.
   ```
   people.push("Mary");
   ```

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position
of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
  ```
  function findPerson(name, nameList) {
    for (let i = 0; i < nameList; i++) {
      if (name == nameList[i]) {
        return i;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it
does not find the item in the array?

  ```
  function findPerson(name, nameList) {
    for (let i = 0; i < nameList; i++) {
      if (name == nameList[i]) {
        return i;
      }
    } return "That person is not in line";
  }

  findPerson(Emily, people);
  ```

e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of
her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

  ```
  people.splice(1, 0, "Melissa");
  ```

f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?
  ```
  people.splice(3, 1);
  ```

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

A list of students and their grades could be modeled with a data structure. An
array might not be best for this because it's possible two students will have
the same grade but a different structure could work well.

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the
data?
Developers could access the student name and grade associated with that student.
Or they could search for specific grades and access the names associated with
that grade. For example, if they wanted to find out how many students were failing
the class they could do a filter search through the data to find all the students
that have below a 59% (assuming everything below a 59% is failing). They could
also access the names associated with those failing grades.
